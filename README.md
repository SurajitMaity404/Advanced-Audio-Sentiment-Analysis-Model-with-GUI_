# Advanced-Audio-Sentiment-Analysis-Model-with-GUI_
This Audio Emotion Recognition model uses a CNN on mel-spectrograms to identify eight emotions — happy, sad, angry, neutral, calm, fearful, disgust, and surprised — from voice recordings. It supports both pre-recorded and live microphone input, enabling accurate, real-time emotional analysis for intelligent audio applications.
